# Sysadmin Toolbox
This Toolbox is created for sysadmins and netadmins which have to get a simple free to use(also for commercial use) toolbox. The tools can be used for admininistrating, monitoring and analyting a network, system or to test some important functions/hardware.


##How can i contribute to this toolbox?
The sourcecode here is just a simple "Webinterface" which can be launched from a un-modified USB-Stick. That means, its just created in HTML + CSS which custom icons, etc...
If you want to contribute something to the toolbox, there is a table in this project where you can add some software/tools. You just have to define the software(Name, Description, License, Creator, Downloadlink, Homepage and a category).
If you have a better alternative just add this in the table. We also have to get informations in which OS the tools will work, if some Anti-Virus/Malware Software will detect the software and especially if the software is working correctly.


##What are the restrictions which software can i add to the list?
The software must be Open Source or free to use(also for commercial use), it must be ad-free and no well-known anti-virus software should delete the software.
